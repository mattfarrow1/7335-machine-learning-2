# Decision Making With Matrices

# This is a pretty simple assignment. You will do something you do everyday, but
# today it will be with matrix manipulations. The problem is: you and your work
# friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a
# restaurant thatâ€™s best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should
# split into two groups so everyone is happier. Despite the simplicity of the
# process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
# This process was thoroughly investigated in the operation research community.
# This approach can prove helpful on any number of decision making problems that
# are currently not leveraging machine learning.  

# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the
# following dictionary object.  

people = {'Jane': {'willingness to travel':
                  'desire for new experience':
                  'cost':
                  'indian food':
                  'mexican food':
                  'hipster points':
                  'vegetarian': }
                }          

# Transform the user data into a matrix(M_people). Keep track of column and row
# ids.   

# Next you collected data from an internet website. You got the following
# information.

restaurants  = {'flacos':{'distance' : 
                        'novelty' :
                        'cost': 
                        'average rating': 
                        'cuisine':
                        'vegetarians':}}


# Transform the restaurant data into a matrix(M_resturants) use the same column
# index.

# The most important idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.
# Informally describe what a linear combination is  and how it will relate to
# our restaurant matrix.

# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for
# them. What does each entry in the resulting vector represent?

# Next, compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all
# people. What does the a_ij matrix represent? 

# Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get the optimal restaurant for all users.
# What do the entries represent?

# Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call
# it M_usr_x_rest_rank. Do the same as above to generate the optimal restaurant
# choice.

# Why is there a difference between the two? What problem arrives? What does it
# represent in the real world?

# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem?

# Find user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group. Should
# you split in two groups today? 

# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you
# adjust? Now what is the best restaurant?

# Tomorrow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told
# you their optimal ordering for restaurants. Can you find their weight matrix?
